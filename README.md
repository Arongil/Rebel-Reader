#Rebel Reader

Rebel Reader lets you learn languages with the texts you love.
    
At its core, the program accepts a text file in any language, and it guides you as you read through it. Because Rebel Reader is connected to the Google Translate API, you can find definitions for words or translations of phrases or sentences in context. Rebel Reader also generates practice by asking you to translate pieces of the inputted text on your own and then showing you how Google translated it.
